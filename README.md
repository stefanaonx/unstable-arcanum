# unstable-arcanum
factorio mod
Please don't mind this, i was trying to work on a mod to add some kinda magic to factorio, since on the latest 1.0 version there is not mod magic (at least not now on 11 september 2020), so after talking to resarium he was like name it arcanum ... but it's very unstable as a mod, then unstable-arcanum ... nice

still thinking on how things will work or if i want to add resources or not.
